# My Leetcode

Hey folks! I will be adding all of my leetcode questions to this repository. Every topic has it's own folder and these folders have sub-folders for each question. The readme files in these sub-folders will give a description of the question way the it is solved. 

My preferred language is python but I am also trying to learn C++, so some of the questions may have multiple solutions in different programming languages. 

Right now I am following the [Neetcode Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). It covers the major questions but I will add some other questions I may be solving. 


Contributions are encouraged! I would appreciate if you could reach out to me  at rghosalk@ucsc.edu first but feel free to add your own questions or different solutions in some other programming language! 

Happy coding! ðŸ¥³
