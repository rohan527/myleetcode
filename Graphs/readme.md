# Graphs

Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It’s used to represent relationships between different entities. Graph algorithms are methods used to manipulate and analyze graphs, solving various problems like finding the shortest path or detecting cycles.

The most common and used way's to traverse graphs are:
- Breadth First Search (BFS)
- Depth First Search (DFS)


Below are the basic operations on the graph:

- Insertion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Insert a node into the graph.
- Deletion of Nodes/Edges in the graph – Delete a node from the graph.
- Searching on Graphs – Search an entity in the graph.
- Traversal of Graphs – Traversing all the nodes in the graph.
